# SaseVolHacks

## Inspiration
Climate change is rapidly changing the world through rising temperatures, extreme weather, and declining biodiversity. Many still rely and choose to use high CO2 emitting modes of transportation in their everyday life due to the convenience of it. We, as VolHacks, decided that we need to act now!

## What it does
Abode is an app that allows users to track, view, and reflect on their daily travels’ CO2 emission and how it could impact our climate. Users log their travels based on mode of transportation and distance traveled. To encourage more people to choose environmentally sustainable modes of transportations, users can earn EXP from reducing their carbon footprint and use that EXP to level up and gain rewards. 

## How we built it
We built Abode using python and used Figma to conceptualize the application’s graphics.

## Challenges we ran into
Since we are on our fall break, we had to work from separate locations and work around each other’s schedules. We had to learn how to effectively and accurately communicate over texts and voice calls, as well as split out tasks evenly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As an all-freshman team, we are extremely proud of each and every one of us for having the courage to participate in SASEHacks. We have successfully built an app we are proud of using our background knowledge/experience and hours of trial and error to make it work. 

## What we learned
During our time in SASEHacks, we have learned how to work together in a team. We all were so used to planning and coding on our own that we had to learn how to split up tasks between our members too. We also learned how to communicate more effectively and how to find resources whenever we got stuck.

## What's next for Abode
We built Abode as a terminal application, but we believe it can be so much more. We conceptualized the user interface of what Abode could look like in the future. We would also want to add other ways to be more environmentally sustainable, such as through food, water, electricity, and many more.
